#The minimal server requirements for the servers used in the cluster are:
#2 GiB or more of RAM per machine–any less leaves little room for your apps.
#At least 2 CPUs on the machine that you use as a control-plane node.
#Full network connectivity among all machines in the cluster – Can be private or public

#Before implementing
#add 
#sudo vim /etc/hosts
#ip + machine name

#Inbound ports w.r.t worker and master
